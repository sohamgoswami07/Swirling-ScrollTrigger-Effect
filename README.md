# 🎞️ Swirling ScrollTrigger Effect

A smooth scrolling and swirling animation effect built with **GSAP**, **ScrollTrigger**, **MotionPathPlugin**, and **Lenis**.  
As you scroll, images elegantly animate outward in a circular swirl pattern, creating a cinematic visual experience.

## ⚙️ How It Works

* **Lenis** provides smooth scrolling and synchronizes with GSAP’s ticker.
* **GSAP ScrollTrigger** pins the container and ties animations to scroll progress.
* Images animate outward in a swirl using **MotionPathPlugin**, following curved paths with consistent clockwise bending.
* On mobile screens, the swirl radius is reduced for a compact experience.
